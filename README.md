# simple-landing-page-general
A very simple landing page for before you have time to put up a fancier landing page. You can see it at https://verachell.github.io/simple-landing-page-general/ . Installation instructions given on README page. 

## General purpose theme
This has a general-purpose theme suitable for virtually any type of site. Although very simple, it's clean and responsive. This has a public domain license (the Unlicense).

## Why would you need such a simple landing page? It's not at all fancy!
Because you want one that you can put up, completed, in 5 minutes. 

In between getting the domain name and putting up a fancier landing page (or a full site), you want your domain name to resolve to something that search engines will recognize.

All too often, when you first get a domain name it'll be either a) parked or b) if you have pointed it to your host, you may get either a 403 forbidden (if you have no files in it yet), something saying "index of: cgi-bin", or your host's default landing page. None of these are helpful to you or your brand, or your site's topic for that matter. 

Even if you plan to put up a fancier landing page soon, you'll want something right away that look OK to search engines. This simple landing page only needs you to change two things (at minimum): your name / company's name, and the contact email. That's it. No embarrassing mistakes of leaving default data in.

## Installation
### At your web host
Simply place these files in your document root.  Usually this folder will be called public_html, but wherever the files for that domain would go. 

Navigate a browser window to your domain name, and the simple landing page will display. 

### Locally
Put these files in a directory on your computer. Then, using your browser, navigate to file:///path/to/file/index.html to view the simple landing page.

### Enter owner name and email
If you plan to use this, you'll want to edit (at very least) 2 places in index.html - the placeholder text indicating the owner name, and the placeholder text indicating the owner email.

## Credits
